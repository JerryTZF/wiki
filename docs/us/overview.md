# Overview

---

> **1**、I have been doing development for several years now, and my skills, cognition, and knowledge system have been 
> somewhat accumulated. But as the saying goes, "A good memory is not as good as a bad pen." Some knowledge is memorable,
> but when it's needed, although the direction is correct, the details can still be forgotten. 
> So, I want to make some notes here. ~~(Just afraid of forgetting)~~
>
> **2**、Building a clear knowledge system is a sign of growth. 
> Otherwise, it is easy to fall into the situation where ***`You think you know everything, but in reality, you don't know anything`***. 
> Therefore, I need to organize my skill system in categories, truly understand where I'm doing well and where I'm not, 
> and strive to become a **`Jack-of-all-trades`**.
> 
> **3**、Life is not just about code and work. Emotional feelings, personal growth, cognitive improvement, etc., 
> are all worth sharing and recording. The longer I work, the more I realize that there are many happy things in life.
>
> **4**、To let others understand me more directly and conveniently. :smile:

### Why Vuepress

> I have used [WordPress](https://cn.wordpress.org/), [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/), and others before,
> But in terms of deployment and usage, I feel that Vuepress is more suitable for me, probably because it is simple and convenient. 
> Actually, [Why Vuepress](https://vuepress2.netlify.app/zh/guide/#%E4%B8%BA%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88%E4%B8%8D%E6%98%AF) has explained it very clearly.

> **`Framework Usage`**, **`Containerization`**, **`Servers`**, etc. More categories will be added later. :magnet:
> 
> 2、Some content has been migrated from previous note-taking platforms. This wiki will serve as the final output platform in the future
