## Differences Between Cookie and Session

### Differences
- Cookie stores information on the client-side (typically in the browser). Each request sends this information to the server through a special parameter, the Cookie.
- Session stores information on the server-side. It uses the Cookie as a medium to mark a unique ID (SESSION_ID), which is then sent back to the server through the Cookie to retrieve the corresponding data.
- Session can store **sensitive**, **arbitrary format**, and **large size** data, as the data is stored on the server.
- Cookie can only store **4KB**, **non-sensitive**, and **ASCII-encoded** data.
- Typically, a site can store a maximum of 150 cookies.
- A session can store nearly unlimited data.

### Similarities

- Both rely on the browser's Cookie mechanism.
- Both have cross-origin issues. It is common for clients to request services from multiple domains.
- Both can be used to track HTTP states.

## Use Case

Personally, I prefer using `JWT` + `Redis storage` for `API` calls in `HTTP Servers`, as it eliminates the need to differentiate between client types and does not rely on the browser mechanism.

Actually, these things are quite boring and don't have much significance. But I'll record them just to fill up the content.
